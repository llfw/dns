DNS management scripts
======================

these are the scripts i use to manage my DNS zones and Unbound configuration.

quick start:

+ the zones are stored in the 'zones/' directory.
+ each zone is an ERB template.
+ to update all zones, run 'make updates-zones'.
+ to display what would be updated without actually update it,
  run 'make diff'.

the actual update logic is in the Makefile.

requirements:

+ bmake (or pmake)
+ getaddrinfo(1)
+ the 'erb' tool (from the 'erb' Ruby gem)
+ nsupdate
+ nsdiff (https://dotat.at/prog/nsdiff/)
