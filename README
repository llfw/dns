DNS management scripts
======================

these are the scripts i use to manage my DNS zones and Unbound configuration.

quick start:

+ the zones are stored in the 'zones/' directory.
+ each zone is an ERB template.
+ to update all zones, run 'make updates-zones'.
+ to display what would be updated without actually update it,
  run 'make diff'.

the actual update logic is in the Makefile.

requirements:

+ bmake (or pmake, not tested)
+ getaddrinfo(1)
+ ruby with the 'erb' gem (FreeBSD: devel/rubygem-erb)
+ nsupdate (from BIND, FreeBSD: dns/bind-tools)
+ nsdiff (https://dotat.at/prog/nsdiff/, FreeBSD: dns/p5-DNS-nsdiff)
